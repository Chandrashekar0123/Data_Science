# Global Population Visualization - Data Science Project

## Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes global population data from 1960 to 2023. Although the dataset contains only total population figures (by country and year), it serves as an excellent example of data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques in a Data Science context.

> **Note:** The dataset does **not** include demographic details (e.g., age or gender). To create visualizations for age and gender distributions, additional demographic data would be required.  
> In this project, we demonstrate how to:
> - Plot time series data (e.g., population trends for India)
> - Create histograms and box plots for the distribution of populations across countries
> - Identify top and bottom countries by population
> - Calculate and plot the annual global population growth rate

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [World Bank Population Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). It contains the total population for various countries from 1960 to 2023 along with related metadata.


## Technologies Used

- **Python** for data processing and visualization  
- **pandas** for data manipulation  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for plotting and visualizations

## Data Processing & Visualization

The project performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - Imports the dataset while skipping metadata rows.
   - Converts year columns to numeric values.
   - Interpolates missing values along the years.
   - Removes unnecessary columns and renames others for clarity.

2. **Visualizations**  
   - **India's Population Trends (1960-2023):** A line plot showing how the population has changed over time.
   - **Global Population Trends:** A line plot displaying the sum of populations across all countries for each year.
   - **Population Distribution (2023):**  
     - A histogram displaying the frequency distribution of populations across countries.
     - A box plot to visualize the spread and outliers in the population data for 2023.
   - **Top and Bottom 10 Countries (2023):**  
     - Bar charts for the countries with the highest and lowest populations.
   - **Annual Global Population Growth Rate:** A line plot of the percentage change in global population year over year.

3. **Summary Statistics**  
   - Calculates and displays key summary statistics for the 2023 population data, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.

Summary Statistics (2023)
Statistic	Value
Mean Population	328,788,572.05
Median Population	10,644,851.00
Minimum Population	9,816.00
Maximum Population	8,061,876,001.00
Std. Deviation	1,018,589,498.49

Conclusion

This Data Science project demonstrates the process of cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing population data over a long period. It offers insights into global trends, highlights key statistical measures, and provides a foundation for extending the analysis (for example, by incorporating additional demographic details when available).
