# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, which details the fate of passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic. The goal is to explore patterns in the data—such as demographics, survival rates, and relationships between features—and to build predictive models to determine the likelihood of survival. Insights from this analysis illustrate key concepts in data science, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Titanic Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- **Description:** The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including:
  - **Passenger Details:** PassengerId, Name, Ticket, Cabin
  - **Demographics:** Age, Sex
  - **Travel Information:** Pclass (passenger class), SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard), Parch (parents/children aboard)
  - **Fare:** Ticket fare
  - **Embarked:** Port of Embarkation
  - **Target Variable:** Survived (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)

## Project Structure

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for data analysis and modeling
- **pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization
- **scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis

## Data Preprocessing

Key preprocessing steps include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, and dropping unnecessary columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features (e.g., family size, title extraction from names) and transforming existing features for improved model performance.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Converting non-numeric data (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numerical formats using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Scaling Features:** Standardizing or normalizing numerical features as needed.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, several insights were uncovered:
- **Survival Rates:** Overall survival rate and survival variations by class, gender, and age.
- **Passenger Demographics:** Analysis of age distribution, fare distribution, and family size.
- **Correlations:** Visualizing relationships between features (e.g., class and survival, gender and survival) using heatmaps and pair plots.
- **Visualization:** Use of bar charts, histograms, and box plots to communicate key trends and distributions.

## Modeling & Evaluation

A variety of classification models were built to predict passenger survival:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Ensemble Methods**

Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation was employed to ensure the robustness of the models.

## Key Findings

- **Demographics Matter:** Female passengers and those in higher classes had significantly higher survival rates.
- **Age Factor:** Younger passengers tended to have better survival odds compared to older passengers.
- **Family Influence:** The size of a passenger's family on board impacted their survival chances.
- **Feature Importance:** Engineered features like title extraction (from passenger names) improved predictive performance.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash

Conclusion & Future Work
This project provides an in-depth look at the Titanic dataset, uncovering insights about passenger survival and building robust predictive models. Future enhancements could include:

Incorporating additional external datasets for richer feature engineering.
Experimenting with more advanced modeling techniques and deep learning.
Deploying the best model as a web application for real-time predictions.
