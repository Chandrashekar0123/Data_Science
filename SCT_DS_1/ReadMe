📊 Demographic Data Analysis & Visualization
📌 Project Type: Data Science
📌 Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

📝 Project Overview
This Data Science project focuses on demographic analysis and visualization using a real-world dataset. It examines the distribution of gender, age groups, and sex while exploring trends across different regions.

The project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights.

📂 Dataset Overview
Dataset : https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/RM163/editions/2021/versions/1
The dataset contains demographic information categorized into:

🗺️ Geographical Data: Lower-tier local authorities
👥 Gender Identity: 4 categories
📅 Age Groups: 8 categories
🔍 Sex Categories: 2 categories
📊 Observations: Numeric values representing frequency/count
⚙️ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
🔹 Handling Missing Values: Filled using mode
🔹 Feature Encoding: Label encoding for categorical features
🔹 New Features Created:

Gender_Sex_Combined: Combines Gender Identity & Sex
Is_London: Identifies London-based records
