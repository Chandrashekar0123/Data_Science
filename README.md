## Demographic Data Analysis & Visualization

ðŸ“Š **Project Type:** Data Science  
ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

### Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing demographic data. By examining the distribution of gender, age groups, and sex across various regions, the project uncovers interesting trends and patterns in the data. The goal is to utilize visualization techniques to gain insights into how demographic variables impact various social and economic factors.

**Key Features:**
- Distribution analysis of gender and age groups across regions.
- Use of visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) for insightful plots.
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Global Population Visualization

ðŸ“Š **Project Type:** Data Science  
ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Overview:
This project visualizes global population data from 1960 to 2023. The dataset contains total population figures by country and year. Although the dataset primarily focuses on total population numbers, it serves as a perfect example for practicing data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques. The project involves examining population trends, country-specific growth, and the impact of demographic shifts on global development.

**Key Features:**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing of global population data.
- Time series analysis to explore population growth trends over decades.
- Visualization techniques such as line charts and heatmaps.

## Titanic Survival Prediction

ðŸŒŸ **Project Type:** Data Science  
ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Overview:
The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project aims to predict whether a passenger survived based on features such as age, gender, class, and embarked port. The dataset contains detailed information about passengers aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic. Using multiple machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, this project demonstrates how to build a predictive model and evaluate it using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Key Features:**
- Preprocessing and handling missing values in Titanic dataset.
- Feature engineering and model evaluation using multiple classifiers.
- Data visualization to explore survival rates across different features.
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Bank Marketing Predictions

ðŸ“Š **Project Type:** Data Science  
ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Overview:
This project uses the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It focuses on building a Decision Tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The project involves data preprocessing, encoding categorical variables, and model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

**Key Features:**
- Classification model using Decision Trees.
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
- Model evaluation and visualization of performance metrics.
- Insights on customer behavior based on demographic data.

## Titanic Dataset Analysis

ðŸ“Š **Project Type:** Data Science  
ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Overview:
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, examining the fate of passengers aboard the Titanic. The goal is to explore patterns in demographics, survival rates, and relationships between different features. By using data visualization techniques and building predictive models, the project uncovers important insights about survival likelihood based on passenger characteristics.

**Key Features:**
- Thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Titanic dataset.
- Handling missing data and feature engineering.
- Building predictive models to estimate survival.
- Data visualization with correlation analysis and survival rate trends.
